Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This program allows the user to do multiple things by opening and reading a .txt file. The program can create a histogram with the number of word occurrences. You can also change the color and background of the histogram. You can also type the work you would like, and it will find the occurrences within the  

What did you do particularly well? 

The code is very readable and user friendly. The code and efficient and can be easily reused and adjusted to read any .txt file. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I believe the code could be more secure by adding some JAVA code into the program. This would allow the automatic garbage cache to function and create a more secure program. 

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

Much like the week prior to this one, I struggled with embedding the Python code into the C++. This took a lot of time and research to get it right. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

This project will help me in future courses that require the use of multiple coding languages. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

The code has a lot of information and in-line comments that help make it readable and adaptable. Any coder could pick this code up and manipulate it easily to work with their own files.
